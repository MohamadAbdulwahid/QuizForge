# Sprint 1 Backlog

**Goal:** Establish project foundation, setup backend infrastructure, and implement basic authentication

**Total Story Points:** 20 (≈40 hours)

| ID | User Story | Story Points | Priority |
|----|-----------|--------------|----------|
| PB-00 | As a **Team**, we want a Git repository with branching and CI basics so development can start in a controlled way. | 1 | High |
| PB-01 | As a **Developer**, I want a Node.js + Express project scaffold so backend development can begin + researching for/the tools that will/can be used in the backend | 1 | High |
| PB-04 | As a **Developer**, I want a shared environment configuration (env files) so local and production setups are separated. | 1 | High |
| PB-05 | As a **System**, I want an OracleXE database schema so quizzes, users, and sessions can be stored reliably. | 2 | High |
| PB-06 | As a **Developer**, I want database migration and seed scripts so environments are reproducible. | 2 | High |
| PB-09 | As a **User**, I want to authenticate securely so only I can modify my own quizzes. | 5 | High |
| PB-10 | As a **User**, I want to create and edit quizzes so that I could host them. | 4 | High |
| PB-16 | As a **Developer**, I want error handling middleware so all errors return consistent JSON responses. | 1 | High |
| PB-17 | As a **Developer**, I want logging middleware (e.g., Morgan, Winston) so requests and errors are tracked. | 1 | High |
| PB-03 | As a **Developer**, I want an OpenAPI/Swagger specification for authentication endpoints so the API contract is clear. | 2 | Medium |

**Sprint 1 Detailed Tasks:** See `Backlog_1_Details.md` for breakdown of implementation tasks.
